# History Hero

**History Hero** is a history quiz game where players start with **100 lives** and must guess **7 correct answers** to become a **"Hero"**.  
If a player answers incorrectly, they lose **25% of their life**â€”losing all their lives results in a game over.  
The quiz is based on **history and war-related trivia** questions.
